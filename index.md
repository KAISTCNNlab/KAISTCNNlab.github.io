How do we come to love or hate someone? 

Why do we want to be together or be alone? 

How does social stress make us depressed and anxious? 

Our lab pursues to unravel the mechanisms of emotions and sociality through a neuroscientific approach. We aim to identify neural networks that control a wide range of social behaviors from instinctive social behaviors such as mating, aggression, and parental behavior to complex group social behaviors. Leveraging animal models and a variety of cutting-edge neuroscience techniques, we explore the nature of genetic, molecular, and cellular processes in those neural networks. Through these studies, we seek out to improve our understanding for pathology of affective disorders, including social anxiety and depression, and develop treatments for them.
