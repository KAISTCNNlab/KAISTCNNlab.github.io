### Educational background
* 2021 BSc Psychology, University of Warwick 

I am first year graduate student, interested and conducting research in neural circuits and neuromodulators involved in sleeping behaviors and stress. My ultimate target for my research is to construct a robust evidence base to inform the development of treatments for brain diseases related to sleep dysregulation.

### Educational background
* 2021 Biological Science, University of Sungkyunkwan

Hoyong is first-year graduate student. He is interested in the circuit that regulates sleep states under social stress. Hoyong wants to uncover how neuronal interactions create high-level brain functions and what factors cause abnormal disruptions.
